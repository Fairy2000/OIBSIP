        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <P>Dr. Vikram Sarabhai is considered the father of the Indian space program. He was a great institution builder and
        helped in establishing a large number of institutions in diverse fields. After returning from Cambridge in 
        1947, he requested his friends and family members to help him in opening a research institution near 
        his home in Ahmedabad, thus at the age of only 28, he founded the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) 
        in Ahmedabad on November 11, 1947.</P>

         <p>The Physical Research Laboratory was the first of many institutions which Vikram Sarabhai created and cultivated. 
        He served in the Physical Research Laboratory from 1966 to 1971. Vikram Sarabhai was also very active in his 
        family’s industry and the business which it had. After Independence in 1947, Vikram Sarabhai founded the 
        Ahmedabad Textile Industry’s Research Association and then actively looked after it until 1956. Seeing the 
        immediate need for management professionals in the country, Vikram Sarabhai also helped in setting up the 
        Indian Institute of Management at Ahmedabad in 1962. The Indian National Committee for  Space 
        Research (INCOSPAR) which was later renamed the Indian Space Research Organization(ISRO) was 
        established by Vikram Sarabhai in 1962. After the death of the beloved physicist Homi Bhabha 
        in 1966, Vikram Sarabhai was appointed as the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of India. 
        He is also credited for setting up the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station in Southern India. 
        Vikram Sarabhai also helped in developing indigenous nuclear technology for defence.</P>

        <h2>Discoveries</h2>
        <p>Vikram Sarabhai helped in setting up many institutions all around the country and here are some of the well-known institutions established by Dr. Vikram Sarabhai. 
        In 1947, Vikram Sarabhai established the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad. PRL is a National Research Institute for space and allied sciences. 
        Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad founded on 11 December 1961 is considered to be the best institute of management in the country. 
        Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL), Jaduguda, Bihar was founded in 1967, under the department of atomic energy. 
        Vikram A. Sarabhai Community Science Centre (VASCSC) or the Community science centre was established in 1960 at Ahmedabad. VASCSC is working towards popularizing science and 
        mathematics education among students, teachers, and the public. Its main objective is to improve and find innovative methods of scientific education.
        Darpan Academy for Performing Arts, Ahmedabad was founded in 1949 along with his wife and now directed by his daughter Mallika Sarabhai for the last three decades. 
        Faster Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR), Kalpakkam was founded in 1985 and it is the testbed for fast fuel reactors and materials.
        Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), Hyderabad was founded in 1967 to create a strong indigenous base in electronics. 
        Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram founded on 21 November 1963, is a major space research centre of the ISRO which mainly focuses on rocket and space vehicles for the Indian satellite program. 
        Space Applications Centre( SAC), Ahmedabad was founded in 1972. The Space Applications Centre has played an important role in realizing the vision and the mission of ISRO. 
        Variable Energy Cyclotron Project or the VECC is located in Calcutta and was founded in 1972. VECC performs research in basic and applied nuclear sciences and the development of the nuclear particle accelerator. </p>
    
    <h2>Inventions</h2>
    <p>The establishment of the Indian space research organization by Vikram Sarabhai is considered to be 
        his greatest achievement. When he returned to India after completing his Doctorate from Cambridge 
        University in London in 1947, he was able to convince the newly formed independent Indian government 
        of the importance of a space program for a developing country like India. Dr. Sarabhai was also 
        supported by Dr. Homi Jehangir Bhabha who is widely regarded as the father of the Indian nuclear 
        science program. He supported Dr. Sarabhai in setting the first rocket launch station in India. 
        At Thumba near Thiruvananthapuram on the coast of the Arabian sea, the first rocket launch centre 
        was established.</p>

    <p>The inaugural flight was launched on November 21, 1963, with sodium vapour payload after a remarkable 
        effort in setting up the infrastructure, personnel, communication links, and launch pads. 
        Dr. Vikram Sarabhai was constantly in negotiations with the other leading country’s space organization 
        such as NASA and because of his efforts, the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE) was 
        launched during July 1975 - July 1976.
        Dr. Vikram Sarabhai was very much interested in science education and founded the Community Science 
        Centre at Ahmedabad in 1956. It is also called Vikram Sarabhai Community Science Centre (VASCSC). 
        He also started a project for the fabrication and the launch of an Indian satellite.
        Vikram Sarabhai worked very passionately to ignite India’s first satellite, Aryabhatta but 
        unfortunately, he passed away four years before the launch of the satellite. 
        Dr. Vikram Sarabhai was honoured with Padma Bhushan in 1966 and Padma Vibhushan in 
        1972 to remember and celebrate his life and the legacy he left behind. </p>
